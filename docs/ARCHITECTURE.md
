# NovaCode – Architecture Overview

## 1. Goal

NovaCode is a lightweight, modern, cross-platform code editor with a clean UI design.
It focuses on speed, clarity, and keyboard-first interaction, while still supporting mouse control.

It is **not** intended to be a full IDE or a clone of Visual Studio Code.
It is meant to be a **minimal, beautiful, and focused editor**.

---

## 2. Platforms

Target platforms:

- Linux
- Windows
- macOS (planned for later)

The codebase should remain platform-independent whenever possible.

---

## 3. Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

- Minimalism over feature-bloat
- Fast startup time
- Low memory usage
- Clean and modern design
- Keyboard-first workflow
- Mouse support as secondary input
- No background services
- No plugin system for version 0.1.0

---

## 4. User Interaction Model

NovaCode follows a keyboard-first interaction model:

- Full keyboard control is always available
- Mouse usage is optional and secondary
- Every important function must be accessible via shortcuts
- UI elements exist to support, not replace, keyboard workflows

---

## 5. System Architecture

### Application Core
Responsible for:
- Application startup
- Global state management
- Window lifecycle
- Main event loop

---

### Text Model
Responsible for:
- Internal text storage
- Cursor positioning
- Line handling
- Insert and delete operations
- Selection handling (later versions)

The text model is independent from rendering.

---

### Input System
Responsible for:
- Keyboard events
- Mouse events
- Shortcut handling
- Mapping input to editor actions

---

### Rendering System
Responsible for:
- Drawing text
- Cursor display
- Scrolling
- Line layout
- Font rendering

The rendering layer visually represents the text model.

---

### File System Module
Responsible for:
- File loading
- File saving
- Path handling
- Error-safe text input/output

No project system in version 0.1.0 — single file editing only.

---

## 6. Version 0.1.0 Scope

### Must Include

- Window creation
- Displaying text
- Cursor movement
- Opening files
- Saving files

---

### Must NOT Include

- Syntax highlighting
- Tabs
- Plugin system
- Git integration
- Project explorer
- Code intelligence

---

## 7. Development Focus

Primary focus areas:

- Clean architecture
- Clear module boundaries
- Maintainability
- Cross-platform design
- Debugging support

---

## 8. Future Vision (Post 0.1.0)

Possible later features:

- Syntax highlighting
- Themes
- Tabs/shared views
- Git integration
- Plugin system
- UI customization
- Performance improvements
